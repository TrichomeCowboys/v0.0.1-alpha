                    Every stage of the grow has it's own issues that need to get fixed or worked around. Usually the
                    solution involves
                    using equipment designed for aquariums or lawn care, not the best fit for indoor growers. Ideas that
                    work well in raised bed gardens
                    rarely translate into a good tent solution, so problems are all solved "good enough" to get things
                    growing. Not good.

                The biggest issue was always how to reinforce and support the individual plants as they
                mature, bulk up and put on weight. My beautiful plants were now bending all over the place, moving
                out of the light and falling over each other right when I wanted them to be getting the best light in
                order
                to develop rich colors and evenly mature all over. Basically just wasting the light that I had.

                Hard to setup, hard to work around and hard to deal with at harvest time. Maybe easier if you were ahead
                of things, but since I am usually reacting to things as they pop up I always had to work it around and over several plants. Then they were
                hard if not impossible to adjust and harvest was clumsy. And then it didn't seem to really help me like I wanted it too.
                Branches still fell over to the side when heavy, leaning on other branches with no good way adjust individual branches.
                Hate it.

                I just couldn't stand fiddling with crap all of the time. I just want to relax, trim a little and enjoy
                watching them grow.
                That is such a nice part of it. I like to just sit and stare sometimes and not be bothered with a list
                of to-dos.
                Using HighWires I was able to add the right amount of reinforement to each branch when it needed it.
                They
                can be positioned exactly where I want them and they stay there. Done. I was able to use them throughout
                the
                grow cycle to train the branches to bend out more to allow light to penetrate all the way thru the
                canopy.
                Combine this with rigorous defoliating and what a difference. I was able to relax and watch my plants
                mature into bushes of buds.
