        <h1>Common Issues</h1>
        <p>We are standing the shoulders of giants here, not giving you information we thought up. [Need to make this better]</p>
        <br/>
        <hr/>
        <h2>Supporting Heavy Buds</h2>
        <span>What can I do when my plant is flopping over?</span>
        <p>This is why HighWires exist! Weeks of work and one day it's flopping all over the place. 
            HighWires solves this problem elegantly by quickly supporting any branch with a quick twist 
            (solves everything). Branches are supported and can be moved and positioned easily any time. 
            This WILL solve your problem.</p>

        <h2>How to Embiggen Small Flowers</h2>
        <span>Why are my flowers small and not dense?</span>
        <p>Popcorn buds.<br/>
            Most likely a combination of issues and not just one thing. 
            Light is the probably the biggest contributing factor. Exposing the flowers
            to as much light as possible is obviously key.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the CO2 levels in your grow space drop below 400 [double check] then the plant 
            will just stop growing. Best bet is to get a cheap CO2 meter and that will let you 
            know what your situation is. The CO2 bags seem to work great [add link to one or more].
        </p>
        <p>
            Cannabis likes it hot, around the mid 80s, so get those temperatures up there. [Bugbee]
        </p>
        <p>
            Humidity affects the plants respiration. When humidity levels get too high, stomata close and 
            the plant will not pull nutrients up and hence will stall growth. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Nutrients will also make a big difference [add name of current nutes].

        <h2>Factors that Influence Resin Production</h2>
        <span>How can I increase resin production?</span>
        <p>Light is the single biggest factor in resin production next to a solid nutrient plan.</p>

        <h2>Killing the Shit Out of Powdery Mildew</h2>
        <span>How can I control mold and powdery mildew during flowering?</span>
        <p>Air flow will help control spots within the plant that contribute to mold growth. Mold wants 
            shade and moisture, so pockets in between the flowers is where the potential for growth is at a 
            maximum. A combination of LST, HighWires and a defoliation plan (link) will give you the best 
            chance for preventing mold without the use of sprays or other maintenance (link to CannControl 
            because that shit works).
            </p>
        <p>
            Humidity control, using Mold Control spray, CannControl, air flow. Heat to kill. Stuff in water for systemic action. Foliar spray and an IPC strategy. This would be a good spot for links to sites that support these conclusions.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a good spot for an idea on using heat to kill PM.

        <h2>Get the Colors to Pop</h2>
        <span>How can I get more colors?</span>
        <p>Light determines the purple color (Dr Rob on YouTube), so the more exposure the more spectacular 
            your end result will be. Nutrition plays a part in that too some I think...

        <hr/>

        <h2>Restart Stalled Growth</h2>
        <span>Why are my plants just not growing?</span>
        <p>CO2 plays a big part in this. Less than 400ppm (?) and the plant just stops growing. This could also 
            be a combination of different factors working together against you. The advantage you get with the 
            HighWires system is that you can quickly and easily train and support your plant. So now you can focus 
            on nutrients, pH, lights, air flow, temperature; well you get the idea. Getting your plant in a position 
            for the best light and air flow, then not having to worry about that, is what you need.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use Dr. Bugbee video to talk about CO2 stalling growth. Nutrient balance. Also, if the leaves can't transpire correctly, the plant won't uptake nutrients.

        <h2>Trim Your Bush</h2>
        <span>It's just tall and bushy, what can I do?</span>
        <p>I hate trimming. And despise trimming large bushy plants that I think will be yield monsters but 
            instead give me many many small bud. At Sculpt420 we advocate for defoliation and trimming out 
            small lower branches. When the plant has been trained and supported with HighWires every bud on 
            your plant will have excellent air flow and maximum light exposure. By the end of flowering, you 
            will have a plant that is almost completely buds. Hard, sticky, colorful buds that are top quality 
            with very little trim. Two foot plants yield 6-7 oz. each.
