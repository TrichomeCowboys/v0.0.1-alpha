            <h1>Structural Reinforement</h1>
            <div>
                When things get heavy, reinforce your branches so they relax, then you can too.
                Great training will then result in plants with extremely heavy flowers in the last few weeks of 
                the grow cycle. So during the grow cycle structure is added to the plant with the use of HighWirez 
                (HW). HW allow you to manipulate the branch with complete control. Training can be done 
                continuously throughout the grow cycle and every flower is supported completely to allow it to 
                receive as much light as possible, which in turn will create a plant with incredibly large buds.
            </div>

            <h1>Training</h1>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Plant training is typically divided into two categories: Low Stress Training (LST) and 
                    High Stress Trainig. LST involves gently bending branches to open the plants up and 
                    create a more even canopy, improving light penetration. HIgh Stress Training iclues 
                    techniques like topping, defoliating, FIM and Lollipopping, all of which force the plant 
                    to repair itself. Combining both methods can lead to exceptional growth. By removing lower, 
                    underdeveloped flowers (larf) combined with defoliation techniques you can maximize light 
                    exposure and help the plant focuso on  producint stronger, healterier and more resinous 
                    flowers.

                    <li>It helps transpiration so it can breathe better and pull in more nutrients.</li>
                    <li>It helps prevent powdery mildew by eliminating dead air spots that build up humidity

                <div class="item">
                    <span>What can I do when my plant is flopping over!</span>
                    <p>This is why HighWirez exist! Weeks of work and one day it's flopping all over the place. 
                        HighWirez solves this problem elegantly by quickly supporting any branch with a quick twist 
                        (solves everything). Branches are supported and can be moved and positioned easily any time. 
                        This WILL solve your problem.</p>

                <div class="item">
                    <span>Why are my flowers small?</span>
                    <p>Light: The amount of light the flowers receive is directly proportional to yield 
                        (some Dr. Bugbee study I'm sure).
                        <ul>
                            <li>Light: Except for the Larf, which are always small and should be removed early in the 
                        flowering cycle. But if not, exposing them to good light will at least make them solid.</li>
                            <li>Air flow increases transpiration which in turn brings nutrients into the flower. LST 
                        allows to to create a plant with exceptional breathability (a word?).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">
                    <span>How can I increase resin production?</span>
                    <p>Light is the single biggest factor in resin production next to a solid nutrient plan.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">
                    <span>How can I control mold?</span>
                    <p>Air flow will help control spots within the plant that contribute to mold growth. Mold wants 
                    shade and moisture, so pockets in between the flowers is where the potential for growth is at a 
                    maximum. A combination of LST, HighWirez and a defoliation plan (link) will give you the best 
                    chance for preventing mold without the use of sprays or other maintenance (link to CannControl 
                    because that shit works).

                <div class="item">
                    <span>How can I get more colors?</span>
                    <p>Light determines the purple color (Dr Rob on YouTube), so the more exposure the more spectacular 
                    your end result will be. Nutrition plays a part in that too some I think...

                <div class="item">
                    <span>Why are my plants just not growing?</span>
                    <p>CO2 plays a big part in this. Less than 400ppm (?) and the plant just stops growing. This could also 
                    be a combination of different factors working together against you. The advantage you get with the 
                    HighWirez system is that you can quickly and easily train and support your plant. So now you can focus 
                    on nutrients, pH, lights, air flow, temperature; well you get the idea. Getting your plant in a position 
                    for the best light and air flow, then not having to worry about that, is what you need.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">
                    <span>It's just tall and bushy, what can I do?</span>
                    <p>I hate trimming. And despise trimming large bushy plants that I think will be yield monsters but 
                    instead give me many many small bud. At Sculpt420 we advocate for defoliation and trimming out 
                    small lower branches. When the plant has been trained and supported with HighWirez every bud on 
                    your plant will have excellent air flow and maximum light exposure. By the end of flowering, you 
                    will have a plant that is almost completely buds. Hard, sticky, colorful buds that are top quality 
                    with very little trim. Two foot plants yield 6-7 oz. each.

                <p><b>HighWirez</b> uses techniques borrowed from traditional bonsai to wrap the individual branches with a 
                    support wire. Solved everything. Simple, quick and easy. I can do one branch if it needs it, or work on 
                    the whole plant. I can add as it goes along, no need to worry about the hardware, get on with gardening. 
                    And if I want to move it closer to the light, or in a different position, no problem, just bend and done.
