                    When things get heavy, reinforce your branches so they relax, then you can too.
                    Great training will then result in plants with extremely heavy flowers in the last few weeks of 
                    the grow cycle. So during the grow cycle structure is added to the plant with the use of HighWirez 
                    (HW). HW allow you to manipulate the branch with complete control. Training can be done 
                    continuously throughout the grow cycle and every flower is supported completely to allow it to 
                    receive as much light as possible, which in turn will create a plant with incredibly large buds.

                    Plant training is typically divided into two categories: Low Stress Training (LST) and 
                    High Stress Trainig. LST involves gently bending branches to open the plants up and 
                    create a more even canopy, improving light penetration. HIgh Stress Training iclues 
                    techniques like topping, defoliating, FIM and Lollipopping, all of which force the plant 
                    to repair itself. Combining both methods can lead to exceptional growth. By removing lower, 
                    underdeveloped flowers (larf) combined with defoliation techniques you can maximize light 
                    exposure and help the plant focuso on  producint stronger, healterier and more resinous 
                    flowers.

                <div class="item">
                    <span>What can I do when my plant is flopping over!</span>
                    <p>This is why HighWirez exist! Weeks of work and one day it's flopping all over the place. 
                        HighWirez solves this problem elegantly by quickly supporting any branch with a quick twist 
                        (solves everything). Branches are supported and can be moved and positioned easily any time. 
                        This WILL solve your problem.</p>

                <div class="item">
                    <span>Why are my flowers small?</span>
                    <p>
                        Most likely a combination of issues and not just one thing. 
                        Light is the probably the biggest contributing factor. Exposing the flowers
                        to as much light as possible is obviously key.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the CO2 levels in your grow space drop below 400 [double check] then the plant 
                        will just stop growing. Best bet is to get a cheap CO2 meter and that will let you 
                        know what your situation is. The CO2 bags seem to work great [add link to one or more].

                    <p>
                        Humidity affects the plants respiration. When humidity levels get too high, stomata close and 
                        the plant will not pull nutrients up and hence will stall growth. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nutrients will also make a big difference [add name of current nutes].

                    <span>How can I increase resin production?</span>
                    <p>Light is the single biggest factor in resin production next to a solid nutrient plan.</p>

                <div class="item">
                    <span>How can I control mold?</span>
                    <p>Air flow will help control spots within the plant that contribute to mold growth. Mold wants 
                    shade and moisture, so pockets in between the flowers is where the potential for growth is at a 
                    maximum. A combination of LST, HighWirez and a defoliation plan (link) will give you the best 
                    chance for preventing mold without the use of sprays or other maintenance (link to CannControl 
                    because that shit works).

                    <span>How can I get more colors?</span>
                    <p>Light determines the purple color (Dr Rob on YouTube), so the more exposure the more spectacular 
                    your end result will be. Nutrition plays a part in that too some I think...

                    <span>Why are my plants just not growing?</span>
                    <p>CO2 plays a big part in this. Less than 400ppm (?) and the plant just stops growing. This could also 
                    be a combination of different factors working together against you. The advantage you get with the 
                    HighWirez system is that you can quickly and easily train and support your plant. So now you can focus 
                    on nutrients, pH, lights, air flow, temperature; well you get the idea. Getting your plant in a position 
                    for the best light and air flow, then not having to worry about that, is what you need.

                    <span>It's just tall and bushy, what can I do?</span>
                    <p>I hate trimming. And despise trimming large bushy plants that I think will be yield monsters but 
                    instead give me many many small bud. At Sculpt420 we advocate for defoliation and trimming out 
                    small lower branches. When the plant has been trained and supported with HighWirez every bud on 
                    your plant will have excellent air flow and maximum light exposure. By the end of flowering, you 
                    will have a plant that is almost completely buds. Hard, sticky, colorful buds that are top quality 
                    with very little trim. Two foot plants yield 6-7 oz. each.
